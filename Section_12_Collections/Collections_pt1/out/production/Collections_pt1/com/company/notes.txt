List methods
sort — sorts a List using a merge sort algorithm, which provides a fast, stable sort. (A stable sort is one that does not reorder equal elements.)
shuffle — randomly permutes the elements in a List.
reverse — reverses the order of the elements in a List.
rotate — rotates all the elements in a List by a specified distance.
swap — swaps the elements at specified positions in a List.
replaceAll — replaces all occurrences of one specified value with another.
fill — overwrites every element in a List with the specified value.
copy — copies the source List into the destination List.
binarySearch — searches for an element in an ordered List using the binary search algorithm.
indexOfSubList — returns the index of the first sublist of one List that is equal to another.
lastIndexOfSubList — returns the index of the last sublist of one List that is equal to another.
